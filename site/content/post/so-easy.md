Have you ever imagined that deploying netlify cms with hugo so easy and fast? No? Me too!

1. I've signed up gmail account
2. Then it was github account, where the login is the same!
3. I've clicked on the button and it began deploying in new repo. It was unbelievable.
4. I've opened /admin url and logged in there
